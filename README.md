Slide 1: Title Slide
• Title: My GPT-4o Mini Chatbot
• Subtitle: A Streamlit Application using OpenAI
Slide 2: Project Overview
• Objective:
◦ Develop an interactive chatbot using Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-4o model.
• Technologies Used:
◦ Streamlit
◦ OpenAI API
◦ Python
◦ dotenv for environment variable management
Slide 3: Features
• User-Friendly Interface:
◦ Clean and intuitive design for user interaction.
• Real-time Chat:
◦ Streams responses from the AI as they are generated.
• Session Management:
◦ Maintains chat history using Streamlit's session state.
Slide 4: Architecture
• Flowchart:
◦ Diagram showing the interaction between the user, Streamlit app, and OpenAI API.
• Components:
◦ User input → Streamlit app → OpenAI API → Response → Display in app.
Slide 5: Code Overview
• Initialization:
python
Copy code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI()
• Chat Interface:
python
Copy code
if user_prompt := st.chat_input("Your Prompt:"):
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_prompt})
Slide 6: Streaming Responses
• Code Snippet for Streaming:
python
Copy code
stream = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o-mini", ...)
for chunk in stream:
token = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
• Benefit of Streaming:
◦ Provides a more dynamic interaction by showing responses as they are generated.
Slide 7: Demo
• Screenshots or Live Demo:
◦ Include screenshots of the chatbot in action or a live demo of the application if possible.
Slide 8: Challenges & Solutions
